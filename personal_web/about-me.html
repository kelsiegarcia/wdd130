                    <p class="description"> Since our big move to this beautiful island, I have come to appreciate the Hawaiian culture and want to protect the native island. I love learning about the Hawaiian culture
                        and teaching my children to be proud of their heritage. Hawaii is a very special place and the people here are one of a kind. Respecting and loving the 'aina, wildlife, people, and culture
                        will continue the longevity of life and new life here.

                    <p class="description">After I completed my full-stack web development program, 
                        I was hired as a teachers assistnat and worked along-side 
                        new students who were just starting the program. I taught 
                        html and css basic classes and was there for student support.
                        While working for DPL, I found out that I was pregnant with my 
                        first baby. Violet was long waited for and was happily welcomed!
                        I then worked as a Manual QA Tester while pregnant
                        and after Violet was born.

                    <p class="description">My favorite things to do with my family is swim, travel, and try new foods!
                        6 months after Violet was born, we were given the opportuniy to live in Hawaii and 
                        my husband would work with his father in his financial business. We were so excited to start
                        our next chapter in Hawaii with family and cousins. Now, our favorite things to do together are to go
                        to the beach with spam musubis and try to foods. Now I have 2 kids and one on the way.
